# Santander Interview

## Codebase as per interview with Satander (Wed 15 Dec 2021)

## Note for Tim
- As we had system issues earlier, I've created a small API app with express called "interviewApi.js" in the "server" folder and a react component in the client/src/components folder (css and test files from interview are nested in this folder too) that console logs fizzbuzz game
- API has a GET request with information from our interview, i.e. interviewer name, interviewee name, duration, etc...

*Cheers*,<br />
